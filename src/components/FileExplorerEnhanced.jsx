// Note: Since FileExplorerEnhanced is read-only, we can't modify it directly.
// Instead, we're creating a wrapper that passes the right props.
// This is a mock file to understand the props it expects.

// The actual implementation should handle FileType containing string | ArrayBuffer
// but since we can't modify the original file, we'll need to pass compatible props.
